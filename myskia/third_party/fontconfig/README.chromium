Description:
A library for configuring and customizing font access.
Used in Skia as a dependency of libpoppler, for PDF rasterization during
testing.

Local Modifications:
No changes to files from the upstream repository.
Platform-specific configuration files added to
third_party/fontconfig/config/(platform):
  config.h
  fcstdint.h
  src/fcalias.h
  src/fcaliastail.h
  src/fcftalias.h
  src/fcftaliastail.h
  These are Windows replacements for POSIX headers:
    dirent.c
    dirent.h
    unistd.h

Autogenerated files (consistent across platforms) added to
third_party/fontconfig/config:
  fc-case/fccase.h
  fc-glyphname/fcglyphname.h
  fc-lang/fclang.h
  src/fcobjshash.h

On Mac, these are the files generated by
  ./configure --with-add-fonts=/System/Library/Fonts,/Library/Fonts
config/mac/config.h.template then has a section added to the top:

+/* Manually added template defines */
+#define FC_CACHEDIR "@FC_CACHEDIR@"
+#define FONTCONFIG_PATH "@FONTCONFIG_PATH@"

On Windows, the configuration files were from
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.fonts.fontconfig/4438
(fontconfig development list).
